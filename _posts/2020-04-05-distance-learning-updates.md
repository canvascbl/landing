CanvasCBL is adapting to distance learning with you.

First, in case you missed it, CanvasCBL+ is free while we're doing distance
learning. Once you [log into CanvasCBL](https://app.canvascbl.com), you'll
already have plus. Enjoy!

### We're going to roll out distance learning changes in two phases.

In the first phase, **which is available right now**, we will:

- Display your distance learning grades seperately from your in-person grades
- Link you to Canvas for more information about distance learning grades.
Note that some teachers have hidden the grades page in the Canvas sidebar
(likely by accident), but it's available via the link in CanvasCBL's Dashboard.

In the second phase, we will:

- Combine your distance learning courses with your in-person ones
- Show whether you are passing the course in its entirety

We expect the second phase to be available by next week.

We've got some really cool features on the horizon, so keep a lookout in your
email for future announcements.

We're also working on making CanvasCBL way faster-- we've got some improvements
that may halve our loading time.

I hope that everyone is staying safe and making the most of their time at home.
As always, please email me at sam@canvascbl.com if you have any questions.

Best,
