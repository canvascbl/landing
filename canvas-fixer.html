    What does it do?
  </h2>
  <p>
    This extension automatically skips the d.tech family portal when signing
    into Canvas. See a one-minute demo <a href="https://go.canvascbl.com/canvas-fixer/demo">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you choose your login type (student/staff or parent), the extension
    will remember, even across devices. No more new tabs.
